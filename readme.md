Please read me...

Final-Project-2 Class project using multiple classes-react objects to display nested data within a webpage loading information from JSON.

Initial design concept:

Ship information site using Star Citizen Descriptions and images.

Featuring the use of Cards to hold small thumbnails of each ship variant, when a card is clicked a pop up will appear with detailed information on the ship variant class. Time permitting I can expand this to more than one ship with variants. Once the Card infrastructure is in place the rest should be pretty easy plug and play.

Still deciding between a popover for content or an expanding tab. Both have their design benefits..

Figuring out how to populate the cards automatically via JSON is tough, but I think I can manage it.. Currently hard coded a single card but once I can generate them it will be nicer.
